/**
 * A cache that uses a bounded amount of space on a filesystem. Each cache
 * entry has a string key and a fixed number of values. Each key must match
 * the regex <strong>[a-z0-9_-]{1,120}</strong>. Values are byte sequences,
 * accessible as streams or files. Each value must be between {@code 0} and
 * {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE} bytes in length.
 *
 * <p>The cache stores its data in a directory on the filesystem. This
 * directory must be exclusive to the cache; the cache may delete or overwrite
 * files from its directory. It is an error for multiple processes to use the
 * same cache directory at the same time.
 *
 * <p>This cache limits the number of bytes that it will store on the
 * filesystem. When the number of stored bytes exceeds the limit, the cache will
 * remove entries in the background until the limit is satisfied. The limit is
 * not strict: the cache may temporarily exceed it while waiting for files to be
 * deleted. The limit does not include filesystem overhead or the cache
 * journal so space-sensitive applications should set a conservative limit.
 *
 * <p>Clients call {@link #edit} to create or update the values of an entry. An
 * entry may have only one editor at one time; if a value is not available to be
 * edited then {@link #edit} will return null.
 * <ul>
 * <li>When an entry is being <strong>created</strong> it is necessary to
 * supply a full set of values; the empty value should be used as a
 * placeholder if necessary.
 * <li>When an entry is being <strong>edited</strong>, it is not necessary
 * to supply data for every value; values default to their previous
 * value.
 * </ul>
 * Every {@link #edit} call must be matched by a call to {@link Editor#commit}
 * or {@link Editor#abort}. Committing is atomic: a read observes the full set
 * of values as they were before or after the commit, but never a mix of values.
 *
 * <p>Clients call {@link #get} to read a snapshot of an entry. The read will
 * observe the value at the time that {@link #get} was called. Updates and
 * removals after the call do not impact ongoing reads.
 *
 * <p>This class is tolerant of some I/O errors. If files are missing from the
 * filesystem, the corresponding entries will be dropped from the cache. If
 * an error occurs while writing a cache value, the edit will fail silently.
 * Callers should handle other problems by catching {@code IOException} and
 * responding appropriately.
